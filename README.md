Powerful Python script designed to streamline complex, multi-language projects.

builder_parrallel.py acts as a unified build system, allowing you to compile and execute code from C++, Java, Rust, and Python directly from a single environment, such as a Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Its standout feature is the seamless integration of PyBind11, enabling you to compile high-performance C++ code directly into native Python modules (.pyd or .so) that can be imported and used immediately.

With smart, hash-based caching, parallel compilation, and automatic language detection, builder_parralel.py simplifies your workflow, making it the ideal tool for integrating the best of an algorithm in C++ or Rust with the flexibility of Python.
